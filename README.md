# CIS_442-Masquerade-Project
This program is a CIS 442 project at The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth

## Description
This program will list all the masquerade files within a given folder. The program uses the python-magic library to read file signatures from the mime files, then compares those results with the files extension. When the read extension doesn't match the files signature, the program returns the masquerade file's name.
